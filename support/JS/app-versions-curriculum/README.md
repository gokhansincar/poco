# About the curriculum of this course

The course follows Gordon Zhu free course [Practical Javascript](https://watchandcode.com/courses/practical-javascript) which teaches the fundamentals of Javascript and creates a (basic) version of the [TodoMVC app](http://todomvc.com) in vanilla Javascript.

For a brief introduction of this course, see the **[README.md](../README.md)** in the JS repository

 We have also a "**[SLIDES VERSION](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1a78GOX2GNlUNSWXmB18Z_HstE6aioU3126CQ4nUU9Rw/edit?usp=sharing)**" and a "**[PDF VERSION](SO-JS-course-nutshell.pdf)**" of this curriculum where you can see also some important JavaScript concepts like *arrays, functions, objects, loops, conditions,* etc.

## How to use the ressources

It is strongly recommended that you go through the course and write/practice the code. The current folder contains all the code seen in the Gordon's course. Each version have an associated curriculum folder.

The most important point is reading the code blocks and to understand what code does.
